<H1>Julian's ISP Quiz</H1>
<p>This is a quiz that will test you on the subjects you've learned today in my ISP. You will go through this quiz as fast as possible, and the first two groups to the end will get a prize. To avoid cheating, I've made it so that when you get a question wrong, you have to go back to the first one. Furthermore if you try to cheat in another way, you will be immedietly disqualified, as I will have people in each group that will make sure that your group will not cheat. So play fair, and enjoy!</p>
